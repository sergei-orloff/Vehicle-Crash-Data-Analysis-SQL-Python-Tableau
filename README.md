# Vehicle Crash Data Analysis: SQL, Python, Tableau.

# Project Objective

This project aims to analyze vehicle crash data to identify patterns, risk factors, and potential safety improvements through advanced SQL data analysis. The primary objectives are:

1. To investigate the relationship between environmental conditions (road surface, weather, lighting) and crash severity
2. To identify temporal patterns in crash occurrences across different months and conditions
3. To analyze the correlation between citations issued and crash outcomes
4. To develop a comprehensive risk assessment model for different driving conditions
5. To provide data-driven recommendations for improving road safety, particularly in adverse weather conditions

This analysis showcases SQL data manipulation and analysis techniques using MySQL, demonstrating proficiency in database design, query optimization, and statistical analysis. The findings from this project can potentially contribute to transportation safety policy and driver education programs in regions with similar climate challenges.

The repository contains all SQL and Python scripts used for data preparation, exploratory analysis, statistical evaluation, and the Tableau dashboard. It also includes documentation of methodologies, findings, and project insights.
